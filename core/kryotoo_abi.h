// ============================================================
// The contract between steam_api(64).dll and kryotoO.dll.
//
// Two DLLs because they have two different jobs, and mixing them
// cost us releases:
//
//   steam_api(64).dll  is a Steamworks IMPERSONATOR. Its entire
//                      reason to exist is that its name and its
//                      export table match Valve's, so the game
//                      loads it instead. It forwards to the real
//                      steamclient and must not do anything a
//                      real steam_api wouldn't.
//
//   kryotoO.dll        is where every PATCH lives - the ini, the
//                      plugin loader, the SteamStub branch flip,
//                      the ownership/AppId spoof hooks. It is
//                      the only half that links MinHook and the
//                      only half that writes to another module's
//                      code.
//
// Keeping the patches in the impersonator meant every change to
// them was a change to a file that must stay byte-comparable to
// Valve's export list, and it meant a hotfix to a hook shipped as
// a new steam_api64.dll that every packaged game had to have
// swapped. Now a hook fix is a new kryotoO.dll dropped beside it.
//
// The proxy calls into this ABI and NEVER links kryotoO.dll -
// it is resolved with LoadLibrary/GetProcAddress at runtime, so
// a missing or older core degrades to "no patches" instead of
// refusing to load and leaving the player with a game that dies
// before it draws a frame. See include/kryotoo_host.h.
//
// Bump KRYOTOO_ABI_VERSION whenever a struct in here changes
// shape. The proxy checks it and refuses a mismatched core
// rather than reading a struct with the wrong layout.
